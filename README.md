# DnDEncounter
Ever wanted to have encounters made for you with absolutely no regard for worldbuilding or logical placement?

# What it is
Wanted to create a little playground for which to mess with Dungeons and Dragon Stuff, had a couple ideas pitched to me, and this is where I work on them!

# What does it do
So far, the features list is pretty barebones.
1) An alignment is chosen
2) Using http://www.dnd5eapi.co/ , a database of monster information is created
3) Taking into account alignment, a set of alignments are chosen
4) Using alignments chosen, sets of monsters of matching alignment are placed into buckets (True Neutral takes from neutral AND unaligned)
5) Buckets are presented
6) FIN

# How to use it
Just run main.py!

# Plans for the future?
TLDR, plan is to create a miniature text based game
Player will select buckets, face off against monsters, and progress to fight bigger and badder beasties.
